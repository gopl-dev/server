# This file contains sample and default values for the app configuration.
# Copy this file and rename it to '.config.yaml' and then update values as needed.

# General configuration for the app
app:
  # Unique identifier for the app instance, useful when running multiple instances.
  id: "local-dev"
  # The name of the app, currently used for logging purposes.
  name: "gopl.dev"
  # The version of the app. You can use any format (e.g., semantic versioning, timestamp, commit hash or whatever else).
  # This is used for logging and to verify the correct version of app is deployed (e.g., via the "/api/status/" endpoint).
  version: "ognev-local"

  # Specifies the environment in which the app is running. Possible values:
  # - dev: Development environment (e.g., for active coding/debugging).
  # - test: Testing environment (e.g., running automated tests).
  # - staging: Pre-release testing environment. Ideally, it should mimic the release environment,
  #            but you may use it for specific checks (like credentials for third-party).
  # - release: Production environment where the app is live and handling real operations.
  env: dev
